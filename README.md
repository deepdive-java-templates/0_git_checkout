# 0_git_checkout

Each exercise starts with a template. These templates are available from Github (the site you are on now).

To verify your setup is complete, retrieve the first template and run it. It requires *no additional work from you*.

This will demonstrate that you know how to clone a git repository, compile a maven project and run it properly.

## Step by step
Click on the green Code button. Copy the HTTPS checkout URL.

It should look like 
> https://github.com/deepdive-java-templates/0_git_checkout.git

Open a command terminal, navigate to the folder you wish you do work in, and enter the following: 
> git clone https://github.com/deepdive-java-templates/0_git_checkout.git

Navigate into your cloned project: 
> cd 0_git_checkout

Open the project in IntelliJ.

Right-click on the Application class and select Run 'Application.main()'

Verify that the application runs correctly, and the course site should update and guide you to the next exercise.
